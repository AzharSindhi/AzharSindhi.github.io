I am a first-year PhD student at [Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg](https://www.fau.de/), supervised by [Prof. Dr. Vasileios Belagiannis](https://www.lms.tf.fau.eu/person/vasileios-belagiannis/). My research focuses on computer vision and deep learning, with a particular interest in multimodal learning and robust AI models.

I hold a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence from Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, where I specialized in computer vision. My master's thesis explored multimodal gesture recognition by leveraging state-of-the-art transformer architectures. Prior to that, I earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the [National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences in Islamabad, Pakistan](http://isb.nu.edu.pk/). 

My research interests include generative modeling, foundation models, multimodal learning and 3D reconstruction.
