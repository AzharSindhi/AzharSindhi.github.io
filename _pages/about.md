I am a first-year PhD student at [Friedrich-Alexander-Universit채t Erlangen-N체rnberg](https://www.fau.de/), supervised by [Prof. Dr. Vasileios Belagiannis](https://www.lms.tf.fau.eu/person/vasileios-belagiannis/). My research interests include 3D generative modeling, sparse-to-dense reconstruction, and scene understanding, focusing on leveraging deep learning for accurate 3D reconstruction and enhancing spatial reasoning in dynamic environments.

I hold a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence from Friedrich-Alexander-Universit채t Erlangen-N체rnberg. My master's thesis explored gesture detection in artwork images by leveraging state-of-the-art transformer architectures. Prior to that, I earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the [National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences in Islamabad, Pakistan](http://isb.nu.edu.pk/). 

Feel free to contact me for any inquiries related to my research or general questions.
