Iâ€™m thrilled to begin my Master's in Artificial Intelligence at [Friedrich-Alexander-UniversitÃ¤t Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg](https://www.fau.eu/) after nearly three years in the industry.  

This marks the beginning of my transition from industry to a research career. Looking forward to deepening my knowledge, tackling challenges, making new friends, and, of course, facing more exams!  

Cheers to the next chapter! ðŸŽ‰
