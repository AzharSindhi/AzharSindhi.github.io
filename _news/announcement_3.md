The journey of three incredible years has come to an end. This marks not just my graduation but also the end of the many perks of being a student in Germany. These years have been some of the most exciting and transformative of my life.  

I was lucky to meet amazing friends, inspiring teachers, and supportive mentors. Beyond technical knowledge, this journey helped me grow personally by building confidence, resilience, and independence.  

<!-- Unlike many others, my time as a student was smooth and enjoyable, except for the final months when I had to navigate the PhD application process. That phase was tough, but every challenge was a learning experience.   -->

A huge thanks to everyone who was part of this journey: my family, friends in Erlangen and beyond, and all those who supported and encouraged me. Excited for whatâ€™s next!
